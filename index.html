            <p>
                The Northwest Woodworkers Association is a forum for
                woodworkers of all skill levels to share their common
                interests.  Our members interests cover all aspects of
                woodworking including: carving, turning, furniture, cabinetry,
                marquetry, scroll work, and many others.
                The group meets monthly.
                Our meetings are usually held at the Seattle Woodcraft store.
                The Northwest Woodworkers Association was known as the
                Northwest Woodworkers Guild.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyone interested in working with wood and sharing their ideas
                and experiences is welcome.
            </p>
